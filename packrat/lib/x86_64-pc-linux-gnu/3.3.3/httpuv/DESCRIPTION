Description: Provides low-level socket and protocol support for
    handling HTTP and WebSocket requests directly from within R. It is
    primarily intended as a building block for other packages, rather
    than making it particularly easy to create complete web
    applications using httpuv alone. httpuv is built on top of the
    libuv and http-parser C libraries, both of which were developed by
    Joyent, Inc. (See LICENSE file for libuv and http-parser license
    information.)
